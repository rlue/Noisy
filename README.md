Noisy – a Brownian noise generator for macOS
============================================

Noisy is a status bar widget for generating signal noise.

### Features

* 3 flavors of noise (white, pink, and Brown)
* Independent volume control

### UI Overhaul

This version is a fork of [@jonshea’s][orig]. The windowed UI has been removed in favor of a status bar widget. As an added benefit, Noisy is now hidden from the app switcher, as well.
